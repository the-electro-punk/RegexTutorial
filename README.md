# Regex Tutorial 

# Description

this is meant to be a simple tutorial to teach about different components of Regular Expressions (AKA Regex) and how they function. The specific Regex chosen looks for a matching e-mail address, following the string of "word@word.word". A basic html page was created with an input field and search button while javascript was used to examine any words typed to see if it fits the criteria of an email address.

# How to use the project

Access the index file from the main folder and open the webpage (alt/option + B). Once the webpage is pulled open, type any email style string into the input field and click search. If it fits the criteria ("word@word.word") then page will display true; else, it will display false. 

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
